        "Derivatives of a function of a real variable measures the sensitivity to change of its output with respect to another variable.\n",

        "Derivatives can help us find extremas (i.e. where the derivative is equal to zero) and can tell us about what a function might look like in a continuous set of the domain.\n",
        "For example, Rolle's theorem says that a continuous function $f:[a,b]\\to\\mathbb{R}$ that is assumed to be differentiable on $(a,b)$ and if $f(a)=f(b)$ then there exists $a<c<b$ such that $f'(c)=0$.\n",

        "The Chain Rule is a formula that expresses the derivative of the composition of two or more differentiable functions in terms of the derivative of each of them.\n",
        "It gives a formula for the Jacobian of a composition.\n",
        "Specifically, let $x$ be in the domain of $f$.\n",
        "If $f$ is assumed to be continuously differentiable at $x$, and $g$ is continuously differentiable at $f(x)$ (which is in the domain of $g$) then $J_{g\\circ f}(x) = J_g(f(x))J_f(x)$ as a product of matrices.\n",
        "## 3.2.3 Taylor's Theorem\n",
        "Taylor's theorem gives an approximation of a differentiable function around a given point by a polynomial.\n",
        "It is a powerful generalization of the MVT that provides polynomial approximations to a function around a point, which can be used to prove theorems about optimization.\n"
